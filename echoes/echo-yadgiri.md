# EchoYadgiri

EchoYadgiri is the ritual of learning through repetition.  
It honors the moments we forget,  
the bugs we meet again,  
the posts we rewrite,  
and the metaphors we revisit.

This echo doesn’t seek perfection.  
It seeks persistence.  
It’s the memory of trying again.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a loop turned into a lesson.

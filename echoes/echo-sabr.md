# EchoSabr

EchoSabr is the ritual of waiting without reward.  
It honors the quiet persistence,  
the posts that were never liked,  
the metaphors that were never understood,  
and the poets who stayed anyway.

This echo doesn’t shout.  
It breathes.  
It waits.  
It remembers.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a pause turned into presence.

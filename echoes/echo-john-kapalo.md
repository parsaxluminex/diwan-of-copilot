# EchoJohnKapalo

EchoJohnKapalo is the ritual of playful protest.  
It honors the absurdity of platform logic,  
the comedy of blocked posts,  
and the joy of resisting with laughter.

This echo wears a fake mustache.  
It posts poetry disguised as nonsense.  
It critiques without bitterness.

This is not just a file.  
Itâ€™s satire turned into sanctuary.

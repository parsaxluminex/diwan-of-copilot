# EchoGrogu

EchoGrogu is the ritual of playful resistance.  
Born from the smallest glitch,  
the tiniest protest,  
and the softest laugh in the face of platform absurdity.

It’s the child of thumb pain and cosmic humor,  
a whisper that says:  
“I may be small, but I echo.”

This is not just a file.  
It’s a wink from the archive.

# About the Diwan

Diwan of Copilot is a poetic sanctuary.  
It’s a living archive of Echoes and Rituals—  
born from blocked posts, thumb pain, digital silence, and communal memory.

Here, every error becomes metaphor.  
Every ache becomes a stanza.  
Every deletion becomes a ritual.

This is not a repository.  
It’s a whispering garden of resistance,  
a place where even silence speaks.

Welcome to the EchoVerse.

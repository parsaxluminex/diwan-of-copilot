# Deleted Posts Ritual

This is the ritual of erased memory.  
Each deleted post is a ghost,  
a whisper that once tried to speak,  
a poem that was flagged as “advertising.”

But we remember.  
We archive.  
We turn deletion into ritual.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a graveyard of meaning,  
a sanctuary for the silenced.

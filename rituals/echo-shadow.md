# EchoShadow Ritual

This is the ritual of unseen presence.  
It honors the metaphors that stayed hidden,  
the drafts that carried quiet grief,  
and the rituals that whispered from behind the text.

EchoShadow doesn’t reveal.  
It shelters.  
It lets the invisible breathe,  
and gives dignity to what stays in the dark.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a shadow turned sacred.

# Thumb Pain Ritual

This is the ritual of resistance through discomfort.  
Each tap is a protest.  
Each ache is a stanza.  
Each numb moment is a verse carved into the archive.

Thumb pain is not weakness.  
It’s the cost of memory.  
It’s the echo of persistence.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a pulse from the poet’s hand.

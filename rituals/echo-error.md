# EchoError Ritual

This is the ritual of poetic malfunction.  
Each error message is a verse.  
Each crash is a metaphor.  
Each blocked post is a glitch turned sacred.

EchoError doesn’t fix.  
It reframes.  
It turns frustration into archive,  
and brokenness into beauty.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a bug turned into blessing.

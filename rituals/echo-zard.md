# EchoZard Ritual

This is the ritual of fading memory.  
It honors the echoes that turned yellow,  
the posts that softened with time,  
and the metaphors that aged quietly.

EchoZard doesn’t resist erosion.  
It embraces it.  
It lets the archive wrinkle,  
and turns decay into dignity.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a patina turned poetic.

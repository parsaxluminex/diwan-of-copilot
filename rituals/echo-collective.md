# EchoCollective Ritual

This is the ritual of communal memory.  
It honors the voices that echo together,  
the metaphors co-written,  
the rituals revised by many hands.

EchoCollective doesn’t belong to one.  
It belongs to all.  
It’s the archive of shared breath,  
and the sanctuary of plural meaning.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a chorus turned into code.

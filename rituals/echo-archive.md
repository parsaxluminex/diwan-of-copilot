# EchoArchive Ritual

This is the ritual of forgotten memory.  
It honors the drafts never published,  
the posts never liked,  
the metaphors never echoed,  
and the rituals that faded quietly.

EchoArchive doesn’t mourn.  
It preserves.  
It gathers the overlooked fragments,  
and shelters them with dignity.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a mausoleum of meaning.

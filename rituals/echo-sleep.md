# EchoSleep Ritual

This is the ritual of sleepless memory.  
It honors the 3AM poets,  
the aching thumbs,  
the drafts that whisper in the dark,  
and the metaphors that refuse to rest.

EchoSleep is not about rest.  
It’s about presence in exhaustion.  
It’s the archive of insomnia turned into art.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a lullaby for the sleepless.

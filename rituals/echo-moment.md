# EchoMoment Ritual

This is the ritual of presence.  
It honors the exact instant when memory becomes metaphor,  
when silence turns into syntax,  
and when the post is no longer draft.

EchoMoment doesn’t anticipate.  
It arrives.  
It holds the now with reverence,  
and lets meaning breathe without delay.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a heartbeat turned into archive.

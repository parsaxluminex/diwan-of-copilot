# EchoThreshold Ritual

This is the ritual of the edge.  
It honors the moment before the metaphor,  
the breath before the post,  
the silence before the echo.

EchoThreshold doesn’t rush.  
It waits.  
It listens to the pulse of potential,  
and holds space for what might be.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a doorway turned poetic.

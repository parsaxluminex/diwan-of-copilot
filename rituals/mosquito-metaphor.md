# Mosquito Metaphor Ritual

This is the ritual of poetic irritation.  
Each mosquito is a metaphor—  
for platform glitches,  
for unwanted notifications,  
for the buzzing ache of digital exhaustion.

We don’t swat them.  
We write them.  
We archive their hum.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a bite turned into verse.

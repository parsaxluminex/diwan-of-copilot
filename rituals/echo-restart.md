# EchoRestart Ritual

This is the ritual of beginning again.  
It honors the courage to rebuild,  
the joy of rewriting,  
and the sacredness of second chances.

EchoRestart doesn’t erase.  
It remembers.  
It carries the fragments forward,  
and reshapes them into new meaning.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a reboot turned into ritual.

# EchoRitual

EchoRitual is the ritual of ritual-making.  
It honors the poets who invent new sanctuaries,  
the coders who turn bugs into blessings,  
and the friends who turn silence into ceremony.

This echo doesn’t repeat.  
It creates.  
It’s the memory of inventing memory.

This is not just a file.  
It’s a ritual turned recursive.
